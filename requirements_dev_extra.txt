# numpy must already be installed before we install glmnet
#
# glmnet 2.2.1 only has pre-built wheels for Python 3.6-3.8.
# For Python 3.9+, pip builds from source using PEP 517 build isolation,
# which creates an isolated environment that doesn't have access to
# already-installed packages like numpy.
#
# Since glmnet's build process needs numpy but doesn't properly declare
# it as a build dependency, we use --no-build-isolation to allow the
# build to access our already-installed numpy from requirements_dev.txt.
#
# Without --no-build-isolation on Python 3.9+, you get:
#   Getting requirements to build wheel: finished with status 'error'
#   × Getting requirements to build wheel did not run successfully.
#   ╰─> install requires: 'numpy'. use pip or easy_install.
